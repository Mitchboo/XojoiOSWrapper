XojoiOSWrapper
==============

Module that brings legacy and additional functions to Xojo iOS

Here is the first of no doubt a long series. This module contains the functions I needed to adapt older code, 
plus a couple declares (setfocus/clearfocus) needed to activate and remove the keyboard in code in the Textfield or TextArea.

For use, simply drag into your project.

Methods available :
Asc()
Chr()
Clearfocus
Instr()
Left()
Len()
MainScreenScale
MaxWidth()
Mid()
Msgbox()
NthField()
redColor
Right()
SetFocus
SetSeparatorColor (for iOSTable)
SetSeparatorStyle (for iOSTable)
ShowURL
Val()

Will grow with future contributions ...
